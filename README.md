# Unifont-subsets
Subsets of Unifont by scripts, instead of plane #. This is currently unfinished.

# What is Unifont?
Unifont is a 16*16 pixel font, known as the Unicode pixel font, it includes various scripts (including CJK, although extension B,C,E,F,G,H and J is incomplete now) and even symbols. It covers all characters in plane 0, and most of them in plane 1 (expect Egyptian Hieroglyphs, Egyptian Hieroglyphs Extended-A (Egyptian Hieroglyphs Format Controls are completed), Cuneiform, Cuneiform Numbers and Punctuation, Early Dynastic Cuneiform, Anatolian Hieroglyphs, Bamum Supplement, Tangut, Tangut Components and Tangut Supplement).

# Why do I make this?
Unifont was splited into two fonts (or three, if including CSUR). One of them is for plane 0, and the other one is for plane 1 and 2 (called "Unifont_Upper"). This seems fine, except Latin Extended-E and Latin Extended-F was seperated. So I decided to split them into different scripts instead. The other reason is that I may want to add characters, but I don't want to sent them to Unifoundary. So I'll put them here instead.
